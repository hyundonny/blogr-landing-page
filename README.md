## My process

### Built with

- React
- Sass

### What I learned

That was a lot harder than I had expected! It was my second time build an entire landing page and my first time doing so with SASS but even so, it took me a lot longer than I thought it would. I especially struggled with placing the background images where they need to be and clipping images to show them partially. That being said, I am now able to keep everything within a specific width and keep them centered so that the page doesn't keep growing horizontally along with the browser after a certain point.

### Continued development

Like I mentioned, I struggled with positioning the background images. I'm used to applying gradients over images and having the background be a specific color but I've never really had multiple backgrounds in different positions and sizes so I'll need to work on that aspect of web development.
